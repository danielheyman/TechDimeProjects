    In SurfDuel, we've made advertising your site easier than ever. All you have to do is add your website, keep it active, and watch as more people view your website each day.
    <br><br>
    We've created a system where sites compete against each other, and the ones that are the best automatically become the most popular. You don't have to do a thing.
    <div class="subtitle">Here's how it works:</div>
    Two different sites are shown side by side. Members vote for which sites they prefer. As the day goes on, the highest voted sites are shown more often. In addition, each day the 5 most preferred sites will be selected as winners and will be shown as winners the next day.
