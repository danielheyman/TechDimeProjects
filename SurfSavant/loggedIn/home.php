Hi <?=$usr->firstName()?>,<br>
<br>
Sometimes you just have to take a step back if you want to move forward. Let me explain this as best I can, I have come to a realization that I have simply over extended myself and Daniel too. I have so many ideas and so many plans in my mind and written down on paper.<br>
<br>
All of these ideas and plans are for the purpose of improving our products, your experience and the results that you achieve by using our products. Together with Daniel, we have been evaluating these plans and are working hard to determine the very best way to proceed.<br>
<br>
We have made the decision to close Surf Duel and Surf Savant, so that we may better serve you, our members. By closing these two websites and with the recent sale of Surfing Socially, we will accomplish this. Moving forward we will focus on further developing Brisk Surf and List Viral.<br>
<br>
These two sites will receive all of our attention as we will continue to improve them: implementing greater functionality, adding additional features, and growing the membership at both websites. Where does that leave you in all of this? We truly do value your loyalty and we are going to do our very best to take care of you.<br>
<br>
Minimum payout will be lowered for Surf Duel and Surf Savant. If you have a current upgrade at Surf Duel or Surf Savant we will be happy to transfer that upgrade for your remaining term over to either Brisk Surf or List Viral, your choice. Below I have listed what is happening, when it is going to happen and what you need to do.<br>
<br>

<br>
Sincerely yours,<br>
