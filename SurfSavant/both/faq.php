                Surf Savant is a website that is designed to reward you for learning about marketing and branding. We help you advertise yourself and your product. In addition, we have many games and other ways to earn coins and cash.
                <div class="titletext">What are coins?</div>
                Coins are the virtual currency of Surf Savant. You can use them to purchase things such as vacation days, stocks, etc. They are also used to promote websites on our rotator. 
                <div class="titletext">How does the leveling system work?</div>
                You earn coins for each day you are active. If you’re level one, then you earn one coin per day. If you’re level two, then you earn two; and so on.<br><br>
To increase your level, you must be active for a certain number of days and then spend a certain number of coins.<br><br>
Once you complete the highest level (level 5), you have the option to sacrifice all your levels (go back to level 1) for a chance to win up to $50. 
                <div class="titletext">What does staying active mean?</div>
                All you have to do in order to stay active is to find the Surf Savant shield at the traffic exchanges that can be found on the dashboard.
                <div class="titletext">What are games?</div>
                Games are, well, games that help you win coins.<br><br>
The branding game tests your knowledge of the industry. You win coins based on your level for every correct answer. If you answer 5 questions in the round correctly (15 questions), then you have a chance to win some cash. <br><br>
The stock game is a fun activity where you can purchase stocks in a traffic exchange of your choice. You can sell it later on when it’s worth more to earn coins. The stock worth changes daily, and it’s based on the number of people surfing on that traffic exchange. This is the quickest way to earn coins, but it has a risk. You may also lose coins if you sell at the wrong time.
                <div class="titletext">What is the rotator?</div>
                The rotator is a page that we promote (and you can too). If you promote it, then for every view it gets, you will earn 0.05 coins. <br><br>
If you promote your site through it, then for every time the rotator displays your page, you will lose 0.1 coins.
                <div class="titletext">Why is my tutorial video breaking apart into pieces?</div>
                We did that for fun. Seriously, it’s fun to assemble those pieces.<br>
Additionally, it is designed to make people pay a bit more attention to the video itself.
